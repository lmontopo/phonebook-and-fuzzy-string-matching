## phonebook-and-fuzzy-string-matching
A simple 'phonebook' implementation including the fuzzy string matching algorithm.  
After deciding to include the fuzzy string matchign algorithm, this implimentation has now become the focus of this project.  Currently, my implimentation of the fuzzy string algorithm is not perfect - it acts greedily. 

###TO DO:
- make the string matching algorithm 'non greedy', possibly using regular expressions
